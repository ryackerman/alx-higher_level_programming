### Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL

**In the container, credentials are `root/root`**

- Ask for container `Ubuntu 20.04`
- Connect via SSH
- OR connect via the Web terminal
- In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:

```
$ service mysql start                                                   
 * Starting MySQL database server mysqld 
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p                               
Database                                                                                   
information_schema                                                                         
mysql                                                                                      
performance_schema                                                                         
sys                      
$
```

**In the container, credentials are `root/root`**
