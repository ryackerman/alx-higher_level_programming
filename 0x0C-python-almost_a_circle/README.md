# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle




## Background Context

The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project will help you be ready for it.

In this project, you will review everything about Python:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file

You will also learn about:

- `args` and `kwargs`
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

- [Python test cheatsheet](https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/python-tests.html)


## General

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All your classes should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- You have to use the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
- All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case
