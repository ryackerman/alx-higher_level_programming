## Learning Objectives

### General

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use `request` and fetch API
- How to read and write a file using `fs` module
## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node` (version 14.x)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be `semistandard` compliant. [Rules of Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- You are not allowed to use `var`
## More Info
